# DePot?
Pot is a discord bot that I (slab) created; originally just for rolling dice, but over time we've added more features... 

The whole project is still extremally buggy and unfinished, but we're getting closer than ever to finishing it.

# Pot Team
-Anthony slab (owner, developer)

-Juna Meinhold (developed, the smart guy)
